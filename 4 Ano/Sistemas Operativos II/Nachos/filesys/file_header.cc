/// Routines for managing the disk file header (in UNIX, this would be called
/// the i-node).
///
/// The file header is used to locate where on disk the file's data is
/// stored.  We implement this as a fixed size table of pointers -- each
/// entry in the table points to the disk sector containing that portion of
/// the file data (in other words, there are no indirect or doubly indirect
/// blocks). The table size is chosen so that the file header will be just
/// big enough to fit in one disk sector,
///
/// Unlike in a real system, we do not keep track of file permissions,
/// ownership, last modification date, etc., in the file header.
///
/// A file header can be initialized in two ways:
///
/// * for a new file, by modifying the in-memory data structure to point to
///   the newly allocated data blocks;
/// * for a file already on disk, by reading the file header from disk.
